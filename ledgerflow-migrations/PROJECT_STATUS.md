# LedgerFlow Migrations - Project Status

## Overview

The LedgerFlow Migrations crate provides unified database migration management for the entire LedgerFlow system. This consolidates migrations from individual services to prevent conflicts and ensure schema consistency.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- [x] Unified migration management system
- [x] Support for PostgreSQL databases
- [x] Integration with sqlx-cli
- [x] Configuration management (YAML-based)
- [x] Environment-specific configurations
- [x] Connection pooling with configurable settings

### Migration Files
- [x] Consolidated initial schema migration
- [x] Combined tables from all services:
  - `accounts` (from ledgerflow-balancer)
  - `users` (from ledgerflow-bot)
  - `orders` (unified from all services)
  - `chain_states` (from ledgerflow-indexer)
  - `deposit_events` (from ledgerflow-indexer)
- [x] Proper indexes for performance
- [x] Automatic `updated_at` triggers
- [x] ENUM types for order status

### Tooling
- [x] Shell script for migration operations (`migrate.sh`)
- [x] Makefile for common tasks
- [x] Docker support for containerized migrations
- [x] CI/CD integration examples

### Documentation
- [x] Comprehensive README
- [x] Integration guide for services
- [x] Configuration examples
- [x] Development workflow documentation

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Configuration loading tests
- [x] Migration directory structure validation

## 🚧 In Progress

### Service Integration
- [ ] Update ledgerflow-balancer to use unified migrations
- [ ] Update ledgerflow-bot to use unified migrations
- [ ] Update ledgerflow-indexer to use unified migrations
- [ ] Remove individual migration directories from services

### Enhanced Features
- [ ] Migration rollback functionality
- [ ] Migration status reporting
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Monitoring integration

## 📋 TODO

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement migration rollback mechanism
- [ ] Add migration validation before execution
- [ ] Create migration conflict detection
- [ ] Add support for schema versioning

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add migration performance metrics
- [ ] Implement migration dry-run mode
- [ ] Create migration backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Add support for multiple database environments

### Low Priority
- [ ] Web UI for migration management
- [ ] Migration diff generation
- [ ] Automated migration testing
- [ ] Migration documentation generation

### Key Components
- **MigrationManager**: Core struct for managing migrations
- **AppConfig**: Configuration management with environment support
- **Migration Scripts**: Shell and Make-based tools
- **Docker Support**: Containerized migration execution

### Database Schema
The unified schema includes:
- **5 main tables**: accounts, users, orders, chain_states, deposit_events
- **1 ENUM type**: order_status
- **Multiple indexes**: Optimized for common queries
- **Triggers**: Automatic timestamp updates

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Configuration loading and validation
- Migration manager initialization
- Database connection handling

### Integration Tests
- Full migration execution
- Service integration verification
- Docker container testing

### Performance Tests
- Migration execution time
- Database connection pool performance
- Index effectiveness

## 📊 Metrics

### Code Coverage
- Target: 80%+ code coverage
- Current: ~60% (estimated)

### Migration Performance
- Target: <10s for full schema migration
- Current: ~3-5s (estimated)

### Database Compatibility
- PostgreSQL 12+: ✅ Supported
- MySQL: ❌ Not supported
- SQLite: ❌ Not supported

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development
```bash
cd ledgerflow-migrations
make setup
```

### Production
```bash
docker run -e DATABASE_URL=... ledgerflow-migrations:latest
```

### CI/CD
Integration with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
