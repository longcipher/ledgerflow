## Overview

The LedgerFlow Vault enables secure USDC payments with the following key features:

- **Secure Deposits**: Users can deposit USDC with associated order IDs for tracking
- **Owner Control**: Only vault owners can withdraw funds using capability-based access control
- **Event Emission**: All operations emit events for off-chain indexing and monitoring
- **Ownership Transfer**: Vault ownership can be transferred to new addresses
- **Standards Compliance**: Uses official Circle USDC implementation and Sui coin standards

## Architecture & Implementation

### Core Objects

- **`PaymentVault`**: Main vault object storing USDC balance and metadata
- **`OwnerCap`**: Capability object for administrative control

### Sui-Specific Adaptations

**From Aptos to Sui:**
- `Coin<USDC>` instead of Fungible Assets
- `Balance<USDC>` for efficient storage (instead of `Coin<USDC>`)
- Clock parameter for timestamps instead of global timestamp
- Object sharing model for public vault access
- Capability-based access control with vault binding

**USDC Integration:**
- Uses Circle's official USDC implementation
- Compatible with both testnet and mainnet USDC
- Proper coin-to-balance conversions for gas efficiency

### Key Features

- Uses Sui's `Coin<USDC>` standard for interacting with Circle's USDC implementation
- Capability-based access control for secure ownership management
- Comprehensive event emission for indexer integration
- Zero-coin initialization for clean vault creation

## Contract Interface

#### `init_vault(clock: &Clock, ctx: &mut TxContext): (PaymentVault, OwnerCap)`
Creates a new payment vault and owner capability.

#### `deposit(vault: &mut PaymentVault, payment: Coin<USDC>, order_id: vector<u8>, clock: &Clock, ctx: &mut TxContext)`
Deposits USDC to the vault with an associated order ID.

#### `withdraw(vault: &mut PaymentVault, owner_cap: &OwnerCap, amount: u64, recipient: address, clock: &Clock, ctx: &mut TxContext)`
Withdraws a specific amount from the vault (owner only).

#### `withdraw_all(vault: &mut PaymentVault, owner_cap: &OwnerCap, recipient: address, clock: &Clock, ctx: &mut TxContext)`
Withdraws all funds from the vault (owner only).

#### `transfer_ownership(vault: &mut PaymentVault, owner_cap: &OwnerCap, new_owner: address, clock: &Clock, ctx: &mut TxContext)`

## Prerequisites

- Sui CLI installed and configured
- Access to testnet/mainnet USDC (from Circle's faucet for testnet)
- Basic understanding of Sui Move and transaction blocks

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy the Contract

```bash
# Build and deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Or manually:
sui move build
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

### 2. Create a Vault

```bash
# Set your package ID
export PACKAGE_ID="0x..."

# Create vault
sui client call \
    --package $PACKAGE_ID \
    --module payment_vault \
    --function init_vault \
    --args 0x6 \
    --gas-budget 100000000
```

### 3. Share the Vault

```bash
# Make vault publicly accessible for deposits
sui client call \
    --package sui \
    --module transfer \
    --function share_object \
    --args $VAULT_ID \
    --type-args "${PACKAGE_ID}::payment_vault::PaymentVault" \
    --gas-budget 100000000
```

### 4. Make a Deposit

```typescript
// Using TypeScript SDK
const tx = new Transaction();

tx.moveCall({
    target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::payment_vault::deposit`,
    arguments: [
        tx.object(vaultId),
        tx.object(usdcCoinId),
        tx.pure.vector('u8', Array.from(new TextEncoder().encode('order_12345'))),
        tx.object('0x6'), // Clock
    ],
});

const result = await client.signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: tx, signer: keypair });
```

## Integration with LedgerFlow System

This vault is designed to integrate seamlessly with the broader LedgerFlow ecosystem:

### Event Monitoring

The contract emits structured events that can be monitored by the LedgerFlow indexer:

```rust
// Example indexer code
pub async fn handle_deposit_received(event: DepositReceived) {
    // Update database with deposit information
    // Notify bot of successful payment
    // Update order status from pending to completed
}
```

### Indexer Compatibility
- **Event Structure**: Maintains same event fields as EVM/Aptos versions
- **Order ID Format**: Compatible with existing order generation algorithm
- **Chain Support**: Ready for multi-chain indexer integration

### Bot Integration  
- **Events enable automatic order status updates**
- **Same notification patterns as other chains**
- **Error handling compatible with bot logic**

### Multi-Chain Support

The vault supports the same event structure as EVM implementations, enabling:

- **Unified indexer logic across chains**
- **Consistent order tracking**
- **Cross-chain payment monitoring**

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- **Capability-based security**: Only `OwnerCap` holders can perform admin operations
- **Vault binding**: Each `OwnerCap` is bound to a specific vault ID
- **Transfer protection**: Ownership transfers require explicit function calls

### Input Validation

- **Amount checks**: All amounts must be greater than zero
- **Address validation**: Prevents operations with zero addresses
- **Order ID validation**: Ensures order IDs are not empty

### Coin Safety

- **No coin loss**: Uses Sui's linear type system to prevent coin loss
- **Atomic operations**: All deposits and withdrawals are atomic
- **Balance tracking**: Accurate balance maintenance through coin operations
