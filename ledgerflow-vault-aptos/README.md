## üéØ Core Features

- **Non-Custodial Vault**: Serves as the sole entry point and vault for funds, receiving and storing all USDC payments
- **Order Association**: Each deposit is associated with a unique `order_id`, enabling on-chain and off-chain data synchronization
- **Secure Transfers**: Safe fund transfers based on the Aptos Coin standard
- **Event Triggering**: Emits `DepositReceived` events for off-chain indexer monitoring
- **Access Control**: Only allows contract owner to withdraw funds to specified addresses
- **Token Recovery**: Emergency function to recover accidentally sent tokens to the contract
- **Upgrade Support**: Supports contract upgrades to adapt to business development needs

## üèóÔ∏è Core Algorithm

### Order ID Generation

To ensure `order_id` uniqueness, collision prevention, and unpredictability, uses the same algorithm concept as the EVM version:

```move
// In Move, we use the std::hash module
order_id = std::hash::sha3_256(broker_id || account_id || order_id_num)
```

- `broker_id`: Unique identifier for merchant/platform
- `account_id`: Unique identifier for paying user
- `order_id_num`: Order sequence number for that account

## üåü Aptos Architecture Advantages

### Resource Model Benefits

Unlike EVM's account model, Aptos uses a resource model, providing the following advantages:

1. **Resource Ownership**: Resources can only be accessed and modified by their owners
2. **Linear Types**: Resources cannot be copied or dropped, preventing double spending
3. **Composability**: Resources can be safely combined and transferred
4. **Parallel Execution**: Supports higher transaction throughput

### Security Features

- **Move Verifier**: Statically verifies contract security before deployment
- **Resource Safety**: Prevents resource leaks and reuse
- **Type Safety**: Strong type system prevents type confusion attacks
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permission control through capability patterns

## üìã Smart Contract Interface

### Core Structures

```move
/// Vault resource stored under the contract publisher's account
struct PaymentVault has key {
    /// USDC token storage
    usdc_store: Coin<USDC>,
    /// Owner capability
    owner_cap: OwnerCapability,
    /// Deposit counter
    deposit_count: u64,
}

/// Owner capability for permission control
struct OwnerCapability has key, store {
    /// Capability holder address
    owner: address,
}
```

### Public Functions

#### `initialize(account: &signer)`

Initialize the payment vault, creating necessary resource structures.

**Parameters:**

- `account`: Signer reference of the contract publisher

**Permissions:** Can only be called by the contract publisher

#### `deposit(payer: &signer, order_id: vector<u8>, amount: u64)`

Standard deposit function to deposit specified amount of USDC into the vault.

**Parameters:**

- `payer`: Signer reference of the payer
- `order_id`: Unique order identifier (32 bytes)
- `amount`: Deposit amount (in USDC smallest units)

**Preconditions:**

- Payer account must have sufficient USDC balance
- `amount > 0`
- `order_id` length must be 32 bytes

#### `withdraw(owner: &signer, recipient: address, amount: u64)`

Owner withdraws specified amount of USDC to specified address.

**Parameters:**

- `owner`: Owner's signer reference
- `recipient`: Recipient address
- `amount`: Withdrawal amount

**Permissions:** Can only be called by contract owner

#### `withdraw_all(owner: &signer, recipient: address)`

Owner withdraws all USDC from vault to specified address.

**Parameters:**

- `owner`: Owner's signer reference
- `recipient`: Recipient address

**Permissions:** Can only be called by contract owner

#### `transfer_ownership(current_owner: &signer, new_owner: address)`

Transfer contract ownership to new address.

**Parameters:**

- `current_owner`: Current owner's signer reference
- `new_owner`: New owner address

**Permissions:** Can only be called by current owner

### View Functions

#### `get_balance(): u64`

Get the current USDC balance in the vault.

**Return Value:** Current USDC balance

#### `get_owner(): address`

Get the current contract owner address.

**Return Value:** Owner address

#### `get_deposit_count(): u64`

Get the cumulative number of deposits.

**Return Value:** Deposit count

## üì° Event System

### DepositReceived

Event emitted when a deposit is successful.

```move
struct DepositReceived has drop, store {
    payer: address,
    order_id: vector<u8>,
    amount: u64,
    timestamp: u64,
    deposit_index: u64,
}
```

### WithdrawCompleted

Event emitted when a withdrawal is successful.

```move
struct WithdrawCompleted has drop, store {
    owner: address,
    recipient: address,
    amount: u64,
    timestamp: u64,
}
```

### OwnershipTransferred

Event emitted when ownership is transferred.

```move
struct OwnershipTransferred has drop, store {
    previous_owner: address,
    new_owner: address,
    timestamp: u64,
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Access Control

- **Owner Verification**: Uses `OwnerCapability` resource to ensure only legitimate owners can execute management operations
- **Resource Protection**: Vault resources are stored under the contract account, preventing external direct access
- **Parameter Validation**: All functions perform strict parameter validation

### Resource Safety

- **Linear Types**: Coin resources' linear types ensure tokens cannot be copied or accidentally destroyed
- **Atomicity**: All operations are atomic, either all succeed or all fail
- **Reentrancy Prevention**: Move language naturally prevents reentrancy attacks

### Error Handling

```move
/// Error code definitions
const E_NOT_INITIALIZED: u64 = 1;
const E_ALREADY_INITIALIZED: u64 = 2;
const E_NOT_OWNER: u64 = 3;
const E_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE: u64 = 4;
const E_INVALID_AMOUNT: u64 = 5;
const E_INVALID_ORDER_ID: u64 = 6;
const E_INVALID_ADDRESS: u64 = 7;
```

   ```toml
   [package]
   upgrade_policy = "compatible"  # or "immutable"
   ```

2. **Upgrade Command**

   ```bash
   aptos move upgrade-package --profile mainnet
   ```
