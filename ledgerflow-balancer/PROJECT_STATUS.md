# LedgerFlow Balancer - Project Status

## Overview
LedgerFlow Balancer is the backend service for the LedgerFlow payment system, serving as the business logic core that connects user frontends with off-chain data.

## Current Status: Initial Implementation Complete ✅

### Completed Features

#### Core Architecture
- ✅ Rust project structure with proper module organization
- ✅ Axum web framework setup with routing
- ✅ SQLx database integration with PostgreSQL
- ✅ Configuration management with YAML files
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- ✅ Logging and tracing setup
- ✅ CLI argument parsing with Clap

#### Database Layer
- ✅ Database schema design with orders and accounts tables
- ✅ SQL migrations for initial schema
- ✅ Database connection pooling
- ✅ CRUD operations for orders and accounts
- ✅ Query optimization with proper indexes
- ✅ Database triggers for auto-updating timestamps

#### Business Logic
- ✅ Order ID generation using keccak256 algorithm
- ✅ Account management with Email/Telegram ID association
- ✅ Order creation with uniqueness validation
- ✅ Business rule enforcement (max 2 pending orders per account)
- ✅ Balance calculation through order aggregation
- ✅ Order status management (pending, completed, failed, cancelled)

#### API Endpoints
- ✅ POST /orders - Create new order
- ✅ GET /orders/{order_id} - Get order details
- ✅ GET /accounts/{account_id}/balance - Get account balance
- ✅ GET /admin/orders - List pending orders (admin)
- ✅ GET /health - Health check endpoint

#### Additional Features
- ✅ Request/response models with proper serialization
- ✅ Pagination support for admin endpoints
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ HTTP request tracing
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Example configuration files
- ✅ Makefile for development workflow

### Next Steps

#### Phase 1: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests with test database
- [ ] Add API endpoint tests
- [ ] Validate order ID generation algorithm
- [ ] Test concurrent order creation

#### Phase 2: Integration
- [ ] Connect with blockchain indexer
- [ ] Implement webhook notifications
- [ ] Add transaction hash validation
- [ ] Implement order status updates from blockchain events

#### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time updates
- [ ] Rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Multi-token support
- [ ] Account linking improvements
- [ ] Advanced admin dashboard APIs

### Known Limitations

1. **Database Queries**: Currently using compile-time query checking which requires DATABASE_URL
2. **Vault Address**: Hardcoded in response, needs configuration
3. **Order ID Sequence**: Simple timestamp-based, could be improved for high concurrency
4. **Authentication**: No authentication/authorization implemented yet
5. **Caching**: No caching layer for frequently accessed data

### Development Notes

#### Database Setup Required
```bash
# Create database
createdb ledgerflow

# Run migrations
sqlx migrate run
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/ledgerflow"
export RUST_LOG="info"
```

#### Running the Service
```bash
cargo run --release
```

The service will start on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` by default.

### Performance Considerations

- Database queries are optimized with proper indexes
- Connection pooling is configured for concurrent requests
- Order ID generation uses efficient hashing
- JSON serialization is optimized with serde
- Error handling is structured to avoid performance penalties

### Security Considerations

- Input validation on all API endpoints
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Order ID generation uses cryptographically secure hashing
- Configuration supports secure database connections
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information

## Conclusion

The LedgerFlow Balancer project has a solid foundation with core functionality implemented. The architecture is scalable and follows Rust best practices. The next major milestone is comprehensive testing and integration with the blockchain indexer.
